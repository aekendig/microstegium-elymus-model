# Annual plant parameters

## events
1. seeds germinate or don't  
    a. germination depends on the amount of litter      
2. seeds that don't germinate (i.e., dormant) must survive to the next spring (1 year)  
3. germinants grow and produce more seeds  
    a. growth depends on competition  
4. newly produced seeds must survive to the next spring (overwinter)  

## annual germination in the absence of litter
*Microstegium vimineum* germination from 200 planted seeds and an estimated number of background seeds based on a neighboring subplot in plots with litter removed. Methods: field_litter_experiment_2018.docx.

```{r g.A}
A_germ_dat <- read_csv("../../big-oaks-field-experiment-2018-2019/microstegium-bipolaris/intermediate-data/mv_germination_covariates_2018_litter_exp.csv") %>%
  mutate(mv_germ_planted_cor_jul = ifelse(mv_germ_planted_cor_jul > 200, 200,
                                          mv_germ_planted_cor_jul),
         prop_germ = mv_germ_planted_cor_jul/200)

g.A_parms <- filter(A_germ_dat, litter_density == "none") %>%
  summarise(g.A = mean_cl_boot(prop_germ)$y,
            g.A_low = mean_cl_boot(prop_germ)$ymin,
            g.A_hi = mean_cl_boot(prop_germ)$ymax)

g.A_parms$g.A
# Stats: need to constrain the values to 0 to 1 (manually constrained to 0 in mv_germination_disease_analysis_2018_litter_exp.R and 1 above) and incorporate uncertainty in the background germination into the estimate.
```

## reduced annual germination due to litter
Same experiment as above except also using plots with litter added

```{r beta.A, out.width = "50%", tidy = F}

# subset data
A_litter_dat <- filter(A_germ_dat, litter %in% c("sterilized", "none"))

# fit non-linear curve
beta.A_mod <- nls(prop_germ ~ germ0 / (1 + beta * litter_weight.g), 
                start = list(germ0 = g.A_parms$g.A, beta = 1), 
                data = A_litter_dat)
summary(beta.A_mod)

# look at fit
litter_germ_df <- tibble(litter_weight.g = seq(0, 200, length.out = 100))
litter_germ_df$prop_germ <- predict(beta.A_mod, newdata = litter_germ_df)
ggplot(A_litter_dat, aes(x = litter_weight.g, y = prop_germ)) +
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_line(data = litter_germ_df)

# save baseline germination and beta
(g.A <- coef(beta.A_mod)[1])
(beta.A <- coef(beta.A_mod)[2])
```

## survival of dormant annual seeds
We used the survival data collected by Redwood et al. (2018) in November 2011 (buried for one year). Some of these seeds would have germinated had they been exposed to a germination test earlier in the year. 

```{r s.A}
# load extracted figure data
rw18_2a <- read_csv("../data/Redwood_2018_Fig2A.csv")

# select month
(s.A0 <- filter(rw18_2a, month == "Nov 11") %>%
  select(surv) %>%
  round(digits = 1) / 100)
```

## growth of annual in the absence of competition
We oven-dried and weighed individual *M. vimineum* at the end of the growing season in 2019. Methods: field_density_experiment_2018_2019.docx

```{r v.A, out.width = "50%"}
# import data
A_bio_dat <- read_csv("../../big-oaks-field-experiment-2018-2019/microstegium-bipolaris/intermediate-data/mv_seeds_biomass_covariates_2019_density_exp.csv")

# choose the low density treatment because no neighbors is a really low biomass (update when data collection is complete)
v.A_parms <- A_bio_dat %>%
  filter(treatment == "fungicide" & density_level == "low") %>%
  summarise(v.A = mean_cl_boot(biomass_weight.g)$y,
            v.A_low = mean_cl_boot(biomass_weight.g)$ymin,
            v.A_hi = mean_cl_boot(biomass_weight.g)$ymax)

v.A_parms$v.A
```

## reduction in annual growth due to intraspecific competition
Same as above, but with higher density treatments.

```{r alpha.AA}
# subset data
A_alphaAA_dat <- filter(A_bio_dat, treatment == "fungicide" & density_level != "none" & background == "Mv seedling")

# fit non-linear curve

# this intercept seems very high compared to observed values

# Stats: may need to do an Alee-effect type model if no neighbors is really low after all data are collected
```

## reduction in annual growth due to interspecific seedling competition
Same as above, but with perennial seedling density treatments.

```{r alpha.AS}
# subset data
A_alphaAS_dat <- filter(A_bio_dat, treatment == "fungicide" & density_level != "none" & background == "Ev seedling")

# fit non-linear curve
alpha.AS_mod <- nls(biomass_weight.g ~ bio0 / (1 + beta * background_density_tot), 
                start = list(bio0 = v.A_parms$v.A, beta = 1), 
                data = A_alphaAS_dat)

  geom_line(data = alpha_AS_df)

# save coefficient

## reduction in annual growth due to interspecific adult competition
Same as above, but with perennial adult density treatments.

```{r alpha.AP}
# subset data
A_alphaAP_dat <- filter(A_bio_dat, treatment == "fungicide" & density_level != "none" & background == "Ev adult")

# fit non-linear curve
alpha.AP_mod <- nls(biomass_weight.g ~ bio0 / (1 + beta * background_density_tot), 
                start = list(bio0 = v.A_parms$v.A, beta = 1), 
                data = A_alphaAP_dat)

# look at fit
alpha_AP_df <- tibble(background_density_tot = seq(0, 9, length.out = 100))

ggplot(A_alphaAP_dat, aes(x = background_density_tot, y = biomass_weight.g)) +

## conversion from annual biomass to seed production

```{r y.A, out.width = "50%"}
# round seed count
A_seed_dat <- A_bio_dat %>%
  filter(treatment == "fungicide") 

# fit regression
y.A_mod <- lm(flower_seeds ~ 0 + biomass_weight.g, data = A_seed_dat)
summary(y.A_mod)

# extract coefficient for estimate
(y.A0 <- coef(y.A_mod)[1])

# see effect on highest observed biomass
y.A0*max(A_seed_dat$biomass_weight.g, na.rm = T)
# Stats: need to add in chasmogamous seeds and all of 2018 data
```

## annual seed viability
Using Fig. 2A from Redwood et al. (2018), 40% of the seeds survive from December to April. Survival is the sum of germinated and viable non-germinated seeds. This parameter would only be applied to newly produced seeds (i.e., multiply y.A by w.A). Note that empirical values for seed bank survival include both viability and longer term survival. We divide by viability to get the new survival value because these will be effectively multiplied again in the model.

```{r w.A, out.width = "50%"}
include_graphics("../data/lit_figures/Redwood_2018_Fig2A.jpg")
w.A <- 0.4
(y.A <- y.A0 * w.A)
(s.A <- s.A0 / w.A)
```


# Annual litter parameters

## events
1. newly formed biomass loses water and slightly decomposes over the winter  
2. litter decomposes each year  

## conversion from annual biomass to litter
We measured biomass from the same area in the same plots with adjacent samples in October 2018 and April 2019.

```{r a, out.width = "50%"}
# import data
A_lit_dat <- read_csv("../../big-oaks-field-experiment-2018-2019/microstegium-bipolaris/intermediate-data/mv_seeds_biomass_covariates_2018_density_exp.csv")

# take average of litter/biomass measurements 
(a <- A_lit_dat %>%
    filter(treatment == "fungicide") %>%
    summarise(a = mean(litter_conversion, na.rm = T)))
# a gain in biomass does not make sense
a <- 1
```

## annual litter decomposition
We used the mass remaining in the litter bags from DeMeester and Richter (2010) after one year in the field.

```{r b}
# import data
dr10_3 <- read_csv("../data/DeMeester_2010_Fig3.csv")

# figure
include_graphics("../data/lit_figures/DeMeester_2010_Fig3.jpg")

# extract parameters
(b <- 1 - filter(dr10_3, days == max(dr10_3$days)) %>% select(mass.prop)/100)
```


# Perennial plant parameters

## events
1. seeds germinate or don't  
    a. germination depends on the amount of litter      
2. seeds that don't germinate (i.e., dormant) must survive to the next spring (1 year)  
3. germinants grow and produce more seeds  
    a. seed production depends on competition  
4. newly produced seeds must survive to the next spring (overwinter)   
5. seedlings that survive to the next spring become adults (1 year)  
6. adults also produce seeds, which depends on competition  

## perennial germination in the absence of litter

## reduced perennial germination due to litter

## survival of dormant perennial seeds
Garrison and Stier (2010) reported that 9% of seeds were viable (all germinated) after buried for one year.
```{r s.S}
s.S0 <- 0.09
```

## perennial seed viability
Garrison and Stier (2010) reported that 83% of seeds were viable at the beginning of the study
```{r w.S}
w.S <- 0.83
(s.S <- s.S0/w.S)
```

## perennial seed production in the absence of competition
Stevens (1957) harvested one *Elymus virginicus* plant in North Dakota, which was growing with relatively low competition and judged to be of average size. He reported 435 seeds and 14 spikes. We assumed that perennial seedlings produce 1/10th the amount of seeds.
